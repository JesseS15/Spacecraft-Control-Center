1/17/23 - Class/Team Meeting
- Prof Akbas notes:
  - Goals for the semester
  - Need to make sure work distribution is done better
  - Have better contact with customer and product owner
  - Get descriptions of what everyone is doing to give to prof Akbas
  - SCRUM meetings during class with prof, what we've done, what we are planning to do, problems we are having
  - Make sure to work on documentation and ask for comments before its due
  - Watch deadlines
- Team Meeting:
  - Jesse arranged teams
  - My job is the physics engine with Jeremy and doing OO to make sure its modular
 
 1/19/23 - Class/Team Meeting
 - Prof Akbas notes:
  - Make sure to have deadlines
  - Have weights/times on backlogs/tasks
  - Everyone should be saying what there are going to be working on in the upcoming week(s)
  - Give Dr. Lasky a deadline to contact or at least send them what we are doing
    - Do eveything we can to contact her until a certain point when we have to just move forward without her input
- Team Meeting - 
  - Each mini-team worked on defining what they are doing and filling backlog
  - I worked with Jesse and Jeremy to define necessary subsystems

1/24/23 - Class/Team Meeting
- Prepared questions for Dr. Lasky
- Worked on making the system modular

1/26/23 - Class/Team Meeting
- Had a meeting with Dr. Garfield and Prof Lasky
  - The project should be mission based NOT anomily based
  - She will work on providing a script
  - We don't need to worry about math that much
- I created a general modular overview with the changes dicussed in the meeting

1/30/23 - Individual
- I looked into using threads or multiprocessing for the user interactions

1/31/23 - Class/Team Meeting
- Dr. Akbas notes:
  - Basically we need to work faster, dont focus on the unecessary things
- We created a more detailed overview of each subsystem and UI designs
- I took that plan made during the meeting and created a solid first draft of a UML for the subsystems
- I also created a potential UI design for adding generic subsystems which led me to create an even 
  better modular design of the UML
- Carly was sick :(

2/1/23 - Individual
- I worked on making my designs from yesterday even better

2/2/23 - Class/Team Meeting
- Prof. Akbas note:
  - Don't forget about documentation, but also don't have all of us working on it
  - Changed presentation date from next Tuesday to the following Tuesday
- Jessie found Brython which solves a lot of our issues
- We will be using python Dictionaries to sort attributes which will help keep it modular
- Started the formal UML design in Draw.io
  - Jessie, Jeremy, and Kyle provided insight on what specific variables and types should be used for different subsystems
- Sidenote: why are dictionaries hard to add to UML's??
