/* Socket.IO server set up. */

        //leaving games, joining games and ending games when they leave.

        //Socket.io will call this function when a client connects,
        //So we can send that client looking for a game to play,
        //as well as give that client a unique ID to use so we can
        //maintain the list if players.

            //5b2ca132-64bd-4513-99da-90e838ca47d1
